SDSU Mathematics LaTeX Thesis Template              Linux Instructions
======================================================================

   The file thesis.tex has to be compiled (processed) to produce a
   postscript or pdf file that will be nicely typeset.  You may do
   this from the command line, or using the "Makefile" included with
   this distribution.  In either case, you need to have the file
   sdsu-thesis.cls in the current directory where you are working
   (easiest, and therefore recommended), or installed where the other
   LaTeX classes are.


======================================================================
Command line
======================================================================

   To make a postscript document you will need to run the commands as
   follows (you must run latex several times to get all references and
   tables of contents right).

      latex  thesis
      bibtex thesis
      latex  thesis
      latex  thesis

   Now you will have a thesis.dvi and must convert that to a
   postscript/pdf file.  This is done with the dvips command as
   follows:

      dvips  -o thesis.ps  thesis
      dvipdf -o thesis.pdf thesis

   (If you have your computer set up for different paper sizes, you
    might have to add `-t letter' option to the dvips command line.
    This for example happens if your computer is set up for some other
    language then American English.)

   To get a PDF file you can then convert your thesis.ps file as
   follows

      ps2pdf thesis.ps thesis.pdf


======================================================================
Using the Makefile
======================================================================

   On Linux, the supplied "Makefile" should do all the above for you,
   so if you just run "make" in this directory you will get a
   thesis.ps produced.  You can also run ``make view'' which will
   automatically run gv (ghostview) for you.  So you could open a text
   editor and whenever you make a change and want to see how it looks,
   you could just run "make view".  The conversion to pdf is also
   quite simple, you can just run "make thesis.pdf" and that will
   produce a postscript file and then convert it to PDF format for
   you.


======================================================================
Printing
======================================================================

   You can type "lpr thesis.ps" to print your thesis.  You can also
   print from a Postscript/PDF viewer.


======================================================================
Installing the class file                            [not recommended]
======================================================================

   To install the class file (the sdsu-thesis.cls file) on a Linux
   system, you can either place it in a directory ~/texmf/tex/latex/
   (where ~ refers to your home directory) or wherever LaTeX is
   installed on the system (on my system for example it is at
   /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/).  If you install the class file you
   will no longer need to have it in the current directory where you
   run the command "latex".

   It is not neecessary to install the class file unless you are using
   some tools other then just a text editor to write the document and
   those tools require the class file to be installed.  After you
   install the class file in the correct location you must run the
   "texhash" program, otherwise LaTeX will not see it.

   Note that you can always arrow up to the last command and press
   enter to re-run it on most linux shells, so that you don't have to
   retype things all the time at the command line.


======================================================================
Not Installing the class file                            [recommended]
======================================================================

   Simply keeping everything thesis-related in a single directory
   structure (see the Example) is the least error-prone approach.
   Simply copy Example directory

      cp -aRv Example MyThesis

   and edit the *.tex files in the MyThesis directory.


======================================================================
LaTeX Editors
======================================================================

   There exist many text editors for LaTeX.  Emacs
   (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is The One True Text
   Editor[tm]. If you are a heathen, you can use some other text
   editor. :-)

   Another such editor that should work with Linux, Windows and MacOS
   is Texmaker (https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)

   There is also a host of emacs packages that help with latex
   writing, some of them even giving graphical preview of what you are
   typing, but emacs is not the easiest text editor out there.

   Other options include:
      TeXmacs (https://www.texmacs.org/)
      LyX     (https://www.lyx.org/)

   Under no circumstances should you use vi/vim.
