Note: \emph {if you need to cite a source (of e.g.\nobreakspace {}a figure) in the caption, include the FULL CITATION, e.g.\nobreakspace {}} [\S 4.10.4 Figures, {\sc Montezuma Publishing}, {\em San Diego State University Dissertation and Thesis Manual: Policies, Procedures and Format}, Spring 2010.] --- The Easiest way to achieve this is to first use the \textbf {\texttt {$\delimiter "026E30F $cite\{...\}}} command, build the document, then replace the cite command with the appropriate text copied from the generated \textbf {\texttt {thesis.bib}} file. If the figure caption is the \emph {only} place the source is cited, add a \textbf {\texttt {$\delimiter "026E30F $nocite\{...\}}} command to ensure that it shows up in the bibliography.}{11}
