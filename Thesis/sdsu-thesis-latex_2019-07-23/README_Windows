SDSU Mathematics LaTeX Thesis Template            Windows Instructions
======================================================================

The file 'thesis.tex' must be compiled (processed) to produce a Post
Script (PS) or a Portable Document Format (PDF) file that will be
nicely typeset.  This can be done from the command line or by using a
graphical editor.  The 'Makefile' mentioned in the README file does
not work on a win32 platform.  In either case, you need to have the
file 'sdsu-thesis.cls' in the same directory as 'thesis.tex' or
installed where the other LaTeX classes are located.


Command Line:

You will need to open a command prompt first.  This can be done by
clicking on the 'Start' menu on the desktop and selecting 'Run...'.
In the dialog box that opens type either 'command' or 'cmd' depending
on whether you are using Windows 9x/ME or Windows 2000/XP,
respectively.  Now navigate to the directory where the file
'thesis.tex' is located.

To produce a PS document you will need to run the commands as follows
(you must run latex serveral times to resolve all of the refernces and
the tables of contents correctly).

	latex  thesis
	bibtex thesis
	latex  thesis
	latex  thesis

This series of commands will create a file called 'thesis.dvi'.  In
order to convert this file to a PS file use the 'dvips' command as
follows:

	dvips -o thesis.ps thesis

The PS file can then be converted to PDF with the next command:

	epstopdf --outfile thesis.pdf  thesis.ps



Getting LaTeX:

You can borrow the TeXLive installation CD from the department office.
Alternatively, you can download the compressed image file (.iso) from
the TUG tex-archive and burn your own CD.

TeXLive is distributed on CD, for which the ISO image is available from 
the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN). You need to download the 
compressed image file, expand it, and then copy the resulting image 
file to a recordable CD. Here's how to download the TeXLive 2003 
(September 28, 2003) image, for example, and write it to CD:

1. Login to a Windows machines with a CD-RW drive and open a web 
browser.
2. Go to http://tug.org/texlive/historic/2003/ on the TeX Users Group.
3. Download compressed the ISO image file 
texlive2003-inst-20030928.iso to a local drive on your computer. 	
4.  Use Easy CD Creator to write texlive2003-inst-20030928.iso onto a CD.
5. Delete files texlive2003-inst-20030928.iso.bz2 
texlive2003-inst-20030928.iso from your u: directory when done.
6. Follow the installation instructions on the CD.

Note: There is a more current version of TeXLive (TeXLive 2004), but 
this distribution does not have a convenient installation for Windows.


Graphical Editors:

There are several graphical front-end editors for LaTeX on Windows.  
Two editors that I have have had good results with are TeXnicCenter and 
WinShell.  Both of these editors are available for free and can be 
downloaded from CTAN (http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/systems/windows).

An excellent FAQ about TeXnicCenter (TxC) can be found at
