SDSU Mathematics LaTeX Thesis Template           Mac OS X Instructions
======================================================================

Since OS X is unix based, everything in the README_Linux file
also pertains to OS X.   The command line and Makefile work just as
with unix.  Since Mac_OSX uses pdf files natively, you should mae one
change in the Makefile
from
all: thesis.ps
to
all: thesis.pdf
Here we will just mention a few things specific to OS X.  


Getting and Installing LaTex:

Here, I think, is the simplest route:
Follow the directions on  
www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html 
You will use i-installer by Gerben Wierda to install TeTex 
(Tex, Latex and a lot more) and then install TexShop.
TexShop is a nice front end which includes an editor, a compiler
window and a pdf file window.  You may also use a different editor
and still use TexShop to view and compile.


Here is a tutorial on Latex and TexShop
http://www.rna.nl/tex.html

The other main distribution of Tex is with fink
fink.sourceforge.net

There are several other front-ends available as well.
Several are mentioned at
